##Bachelor of Science in Computer Science
###Emory University 2013-2016

Here you can find all the projects and assignments that I worked on during my undergraduate at Emory University. I also took two graduate level courses.

###Some code that I'd like to highlight:

CS171: [Facespace - simple facebook BST] (https://github.com/tameravci/EmoryCS/tree/master/Intro%20to%20CS171/Facebook%20project)
       [GuessingGame] (https://github.com/tameravci/EmoryCS/tree/master/Intro%20to%20CS171/Guessing_Game%20-hw1)

CS323: [AutoComplete], MST, IntroSort

CS540: ClassScheduler (software engineering project with a team - MEAN stack)

CS551: All the projects -UNIX 

###Notes:
Most of the code here is my own and using it without giving credit would be an honor code violation.
Some code lacks documentation.
Feel free to point out my mistakes and suggest improvements.
98% of these assignments received perfect grades.
